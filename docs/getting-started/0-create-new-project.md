# Getting Started

Eventual is a set of NPM packages and a CDK Construct that helps you build microservices and provision corresponding AWS resources.

## 0. Pre-requisites

Before getting started with Eventual, you'll need:

- [Node JS 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- An [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## 1. Create a new project

To create a new Eventual project, run:

```
npm create eventual my-eventual-app
```

## 2. Choose your preferred IaC platform

Eventual supports two IaC platforms: AWS CDK and AWS SST. You'll be prompted to choose between them when you create a new project. Select `aws-cdk` or `aws-sst` as appropriate.

```
? target: (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ aws-cdk
  aws-sst
```

## 3. Deploy

To deploy your Eventual project, run the appropriate command for your chosen IaC platform:

- For CDK: `npx cdk deploy`
- For SST: `npx sst deploy`

## 4. Next Steps

Once you've deployed your Eventual project, you can proceed to the corresponding documentation for your chosen IaC platform:

1. [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](./2-aws-cdk.md) - an AWS developer experience
2. [AWS SST](./1-aws-sst.md) - an AWS developer experience optimized for serverless
