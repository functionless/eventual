# Overview

Welcome to Eventual!

## Introduction

Eventual is a code-first service and software development kit (SDK) that helps developers build and evolve event-driven architectures using modern infrastructure-as-code. Its composable service model is designed for building and evolving microservice architectures, simplifying the process of building, deploying, and maintaining these systems by providing a set of libraries and APIs that abstract away the complexities of distributed systems.

## Getting Started

- [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) - set up a new project, deploy it to the cloud and test it out.

## Building Blocks

- [Service](./guide/service.md) - a collection of workflows, activities, and event handlers that represent a business domain or capability.
- [API (Request/Response)](./guide/api.md) - a REST API Gateway that enables clients to interact with your service's workflows and activities.
- [Events (Pub/Sub)](./guide/event.md) - an Event Bus that enables your service to publish and subscribe to events.
- [Workflows](./guide/workflow.md) - a set of orchestrated activities that represent a long-running process or business logic.
- [Activities](./guide/activity.md) - a set of functions that represent a single unit of work.
- [Unit Testing](./guide/unit-testing.md) - API reference, guidelines and best practices for writing unit tests for your Eventual service.
- [CLI](./guide/cli.md) - the Eventual command-line interface (CLI) provides tools for interacting with your service from the terminal.
